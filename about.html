							<h3>The first submarine station</h3>
							<p>The Future Warfare Corporation started as a business specialized in submarines armored vehicles. From excellents alloys and technologies our beloved founder draw the first design of a submarine station capable of harboring 500 men, two kilometers down sea level.</p>
							<p>Used in the first international Water War, it was one of many assets that allowed the Nation to overcome its ennemies. Capable of launching numerous nuclear heads from deep below without getting spotted, it was also able to defend itself from submarines and was too deep in the water for any other form of weaponry to get at it. Hell! Some of them were not even found after the wars!</p>

							<h3>The war mecas</h3>
							<p>After dominating the seas, FWC started to manufacture war mecas. These machines only existed in science fiction but we made it a reality! It is said that the CEO himself draw the first blueprints of this first war meca.</p>
							<p>The WM#2.6, the first prototype that was ever able to be deployed on a battlefield. While AI could have drove this technological beauty, two men inside the bot would operate it for strategic purposes.</p>
							<p>Since then, most of the ancient war mecas have been bought by the construction business, inventing new uses that were later inplemented in the new versions.</p>

							<h3>Space conquer</h3>
							<p>Space vehicles were the logic choice after our terrestrial venture. Warfare is everywhere and at the time of the first encounters with non-human species, it was needed for the Nation to defend itself. That is what FWC provided.</p>
							<p>This space shuttle was our first to fly to Mars, land there and came back on earth. It was used to establish the first Martian base and was the ultimate experience to upgrade our technologies to the next level.</p>
							<p>The SS#3.4 is fully armored and equipped with a range of weapons that can shoot in open space. With its closed water loop and growing space, Humans could survive almost for ever in outterspace.</p>

							<h3>Space Stations</h3>
							<p>The journey of armored technologies brought us up into space, it was only logical that we would engineer the first floating station ever inhabited. It was for a long time the legal and official base for our corporation.</p>
							<p>This precise unit is still in Terra's orbit, although originally built for ten thousand people to live in, it has been upgraded since and can now shelter almost half a million souls.</p>
							<p>It is true that the condition on most of our planet makes it impossible for us to survive down there, but with the intelligence and resilience of humanity, we now offer prosperous way of living in outter space!</p>
